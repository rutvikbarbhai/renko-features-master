## <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcdcffb4-c4e2-40ee-84cc-aca8612d257e" width="30px">Summary

This repository implements an end-to-end quantitative machine learning pipeline developed during the Xcitium–NuFintech Internship. 
The project focuses on transforming raw financial features into interpretable, statistically validated, and production-ready trading patterns using leakage-safe feature engineering, decision tree–based clustering, and rigorous multi-stage validation using renko dataset . The core philosophy of this project is robustness over complexity — prioritizing explainability, out-of-sample reliability, and temporal stability rather than black-box performance.

### <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6672ee8c-15ed-4fb5-9cd5-63c04ac747c1" height="20px" style="vertical-align:bottom;"> Working:
Four-stage feature reduction process applied to prevent data leakage and optimize model performance:  

- 1️⃣ Analyzed **190 raw features** for redundancy via correlation analysis, low-variance detection, and one-hot group identification.
- 2️⃣ Performed **80/20 stratified train-test split BEFORE any feature engineering** to ensure zero information leakage, created target-encoded features using only training data statistics.
- 3️⃣ Reduced features from **81 to 50** through time-window consolidation (kept 5d, dropped other variants), domain-based filtering with Random Forest importance verification, and final importance-based ranking.
- 4️⃣ Validated that feature reduction maintained test performance while reducing overfitting.
